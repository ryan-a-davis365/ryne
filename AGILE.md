## Overview

I used Google Sheets to make a table to plan out my sprints for this project. I split pretty much all user stories into several epics. I then toggled the priority to represent must-haves, 
should-haves, could-haves, etc. The priority of Each ticket would vary from sprint to sprint in line with an agile methodology ensuring each sprint is focused on the most critical tasks
required to provide the necessary MVP.

This sprint aims to expand on the last sprint by being able to search for products by category, description etc. I need to make the models to hold the product/category data, upload some
products and then create the views to display the data to the user. This process will include creating the product admin page so I can manually add them to the site.

### Sprint 4 Notes
